        <header><h3>About Me</h3></header>
        <p>Ever since I started school I have loved maths. Throughout my education it has always been a strong focus of mine. I was first introduced to coding during my A-Level in computing, but it wasn't until university that I developed a passion for it.</p>
        <img class="maths-img" src="./images/mathsStock.jpg" alt="A selection of mathematical symbols, graphs and equations" height="400" width="600">
        <p>When I started coding at University in my undergraduate degree in maths I learnt how to program in FORTRAN.
             I wrote a program for my 4th year project to solve the Lorenz Equations. When I did my Masters in fluid dynamics I continued to write 
             in FORTRAN for many projects. For my dissertation I taught myself C++ and wrote a program to track diffusion across two different fluids. 
             I went on to become a maths teacher in secondary schools but I am now ready for a new challenge and want to become a software engineer. Manchester codes has 
             reignited my passion for coding.</p>

        <p id="newbie"> I have been on the Manchester codes course for 2 weeks and I have learnt so much already. My favourite parts have been the CLI murder mystery and using HTML and CSS to create my first webpages.</p>
